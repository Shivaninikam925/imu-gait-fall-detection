Total ARFF files: 200

"The WISDM v1.1 dataset contains 200 ARFF files.
Each ARFF file corresponds to one subject performing multiple activities captured through accelerometer or gyroscope sensors on phone or smartwatch.
More ARFF files = more users = more movement samples = better model generalization.”

The dataset has 18 activity classes(A-S):
Waling = A
jogging = B
stairs = C
sitting = D
standing = E
typing = F
teeth = G
soup = H
chips = I
pasta = J
drinking = K
sandwich = L
kicking = M
catch = O
dribbling = P
writing = Q
clapping = R
folding = S

>>Computed the distribution across all ARFF files and found the counts are similar.
  Hence, the dataset is balanced.
